# Documentation

Thanks for using Excalibur! We hope you enjoy using it.

<a href="https://github.com/excaliburjs/Excalibur/releases/tag/v{{pkg.version}}" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg">**Latest Release:** {{pkg.version}}</a>

## Where to Begin

To get started using Excalibur, be sure to check out our [install guide](install.html). After that
check out our introduction in the [Quick Start](quickstart.html) section. If you really want to get down deep,
you can view the [API Reference](/docs/api).

We also have complete game examples on the [Showcases](/showcases.html) page and the [samples repository](http://github.com/excaliburjs/samples) on GitHub.

## Contributing to the Documentation

We'd love it if you contributed to the documentation. It can be as simple as fixing spelling mistakes or
grammatical errors. It could be as large as writing an entire tutorial on, say, implementing shadows or lighting.

To edit a page you're on, look for the link at the bottom that says **Contribute to or modify this page**.

To write bigger tutorials or documentation pages, visit our [GitHub repository for this site]({{pkg.homepage}}).
