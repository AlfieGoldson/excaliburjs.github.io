# Documentation

Thanks for using Excalibur! We hope you enjoy using it.

<a href="https://github.com/excaliburjs/Excalibur/releases/tag/v{{pkg.version}}" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg">**Latest Release:** {{pkg.version}}</a>

## Where to Begin

To get started using Excalibur, be sure to check out our [install guide](install.html). After that
check out our introduction in the [Quick Start](quickstart.html) section. 

## API Documentation

The API references (see sidebar) are generated from the Excalibur source code. The [Edge Documentation](/docs/api/edge) is always kept up-to-date with the `master` branch of Excalibur.

The API docs are an excellent way to familiarize yourself with Excalibur and contain lots of explanations and sample snippets.

## Samples

We also have complete game examples on the [Showcases](/showcases.html) page and sample games on our
[GitHub organization](http://github.com/excaliburjs).

## Contributing to the Documentation

We'd love it if you contributed to the documentation. It can be as simple as fixing spelling mistakes or
grammatical errors. It could be as large as writing an entire tutorial on, say, implementing shadows or lighting.

To edit a page you're on, look for the link at the bottom that says **Contribute to or modify this page**.

To write bigger tutorials or documentation pages, visit our [GitHub repository for this site]({{pkg.homepage}}).
